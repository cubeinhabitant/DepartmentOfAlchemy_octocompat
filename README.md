# Department of Alchemy OctoBanger compatibility firmare

This firmware is designed to mimic an OctoBanger: http://buttonbanger.com/?page_id=164

## Getting Started

It is still under development and not currently useful as a prop controller.

### Installing

The firmware can currently be compiled and uploaded via the Arduin IDE to
and Ardunino Zero via the programming USB port.

### Usage

Right now the firmware is being designed on an Arduino Zero so that the
OctoBanger Windows GUI can communicate over the programming USB and a
serial terminal opened on the native USB port can monitor debug information
useful in development.
